## 9. SSH Tool (First-time setup and usage)

The **SSH Tool** allows secure access to the robot for advanced features and maintenance.

⚠️ **Important**
- **Public key injection is required only once**
- **SSH must be re-enabled after every robot reboot**, if SSH access is needed

---

### Overview: how SSH works in ClicBot Dev Tools

There are **two different steps**:

**First time only**
- Generate a public key file (`.pub`)
- Upload `enabler.zip` to the robot
- Inject the public key

**Every time the robot is restarted**
- Upload `enabler.zip`
- Enable SSH

---

## First-time setup (required only once)

### Step 1 – Generate the public key file

On **Windows**:

1. Press **Win + R**, type `cmd`, then press **Enter**
2. In the command prompt, type:

ssh-keygen

3. When asked:
   - **File location** → press **Enter** (default is fine)
   - **Passphrase** → press **Enter** (leave empty)

4. Two files will be created automatically:
   - `id_rsa` → **private key** (keep this file safe on your PC)
   - `id_rsa.pub` → **public key**

5. Rename the public key file:

id_rsa.pub → publickey.pub

This file will be used only for SSH activation.

---

### Step 2 – Upload `enabler.zip` to the robot

1. In **ClicBot Dev Tools**, click **Upload ZIP**
2. Select `enabler.zip`
3. Start the application on the robot (**Play**)

This prepares the robot for SSH activation.

---

### Step 3 – Inject the public key (one time only)

1. Open **SSH Tool**
2. Load the file `publickey.pub`
3. Click **Inject Public Key**

✅ The public key is now stored on the robot  
❗ This step will **not** be required again

---

## Enabling SSH (required after every robot reboot)

Each time the robot is restarted, SSH must be enabled again if you need it.

### Steps

1. Upload `enabler.zip` to the robot
2. Start the application on the robot
3. Open **SSH Tool**
4. Click **Enable SSH**

✅ SSH is now active

> ℹ️ If SSH is not needed, this step can be skipped.

---

## Connecting to the robot via SSH (from PC)

To connect to the robot via SSH, the **private key must be available on your PC**.

Example command:

ssh -i clicbot_key root@IP_CLICBOT

## Important notes

- Public key injection is required **only once**
- SSH must be enabled **after every robot reboot**
- The private key (`id_rsa`) must be kept safe on your PC
- Do not delete the public key file after setup
- SSH access is optional and only required when needed

---
