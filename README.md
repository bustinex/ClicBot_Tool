⚠️ **Important Notice**

I am not a professional software developer.
ClicBot Dev Tools started as a personal experimental project to organize my research and build my own block-based system.

The interface and structure may not follow standard software conventions, and some parts may feel confusing.
This project evolved naturally over time as new features were added.

It is shared to help others, but please understand that it is an evolving personal tool.

## Download

**Windows security notice (SmartScreen / Defender):**  
This EXE is currently **not code-signed**, so Windows may warn you (SmartScreen) or quarantine it.  
If you downloaded it from the this Releases page, you can restore it in Windows Security and choose “Run anyway” when prompted.
